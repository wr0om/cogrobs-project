# Cognitive Robotics Project: Using a Drone to Combat Enemy Drones
This project provides Webots simulations of a drone that can combat enemy drones. Enemy drone have varying levels of complications, and the drone must use a PID controller to combat them. The drone uses various planning algorithms to determine the best course of action to take.


### Installation
To install the project, clone the repository and install the required packages in the requirements.txt file (REMEMBER TO ADD). The project requires Webots to be installed on your machine. The project was tested on Webots R2023b.

### Usage
To run the project, open the Webots world file in the Webots application. The `base_world.wbproj` world file is located in the `worlds` folder. The drone will automatically start flying and combating the enemy drones. 

In order to change the enemy drone movement BLA BLA.

In order to change the planning algorithm BLA BLA.

### credits
Huge credit to https://github.com/alpinmaarif/Webots-DJI-Mavic-2-Pro-PID-Controller for the drone controller code. Additionally, the help of https://github.com/Noam-Sasson/cogrobs-project was invaluable for getting the drone controller working properly.
